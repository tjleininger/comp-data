comp-data
=========

Contains code to run a compositional data model in R. The model is discussed in [Leininger et. al (2013)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13253-013-0145-y) and [Allen et al. (2013)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-013-9916-7). My personal version updates the spatial random effects via a C extension and is therefore MUCH faster.
