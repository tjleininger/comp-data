comp-data
=========

Contains code to run compositional data model in R. The model is discussed in Allen et al. (submitted) and Leininger et al. (in preparation). My personal version updates the spatial random effects via a C extension and is therefore MUCh faster. I am planning some improvements to it before I post it here.

See Downloads section for stable code to generate sample data and fit the compositional data model.
